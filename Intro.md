# Accomplished-leetcoder
A collection of solutions to all Leetcode questions I have attempted so far (and yes they do run, surprisingly)


🚀 What’s Inside?  
- Code that actually works (most of the time).  
- Solutions ranging from "Easiest problem ever" to "Why am I even doing this?".  
- Occasional brute-force disasters because optimization is overrated.  

🔥 Warning:  
- May contain unnecessary print statements for debugging therapy.  
- Side effects include questioning your life choices and a strong urge to Google "optimal solution."  

🏆 Current Status:  
- Still battling Leetcode’s "Hard" problems.  
- Probably stuck on a DP question as you read this.
- Or debating my odds at taking therapy
